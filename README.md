# Test-Version2

# Description

Test app is an application where Mock up service is used. It's a fake rest API that returns all the JSON data we need for this application. The features that are implemented: 
 - Display all the data,
 - Enable data search,
 - Delete data from the list,
 - Display loading spinner for any service call,
 - Lazy loading (with some bug).
 
 # Lazy loading bug
 
 When scrolling, new data was loaded but it did not look nice because the scroll is back to the beginning of the list.
 
 # Tehnical choices

 - HTML,
 - JQuery v2.1.1,
 - CSS,
 - Bootstrap(css, js).

JQuery is a Javascript library designed to ease the client-side scripting of HTML. JQuery comprising a modular set of platform agnostic methods for handling various requirements of the dynamic web, such as running calls on AJAX, traversing and selecting DOM elements, parsing animations and transition effects, manipulating page elements etc. It standardize the task of front-end development and user interaction elements. It is fast, concise and very flexible. There are various plugins available for jQuery too, but these are some of the more broad reasons to choose jQuery.

Bootstrap - The bootstrap css and js file is used because of the collapse panel. It's a very useful thing to quickly create and display collapse panels.
